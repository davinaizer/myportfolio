Hello. Iʼm Davi, a problem solver who loves helping people come up with new ideas and solutions.
_______________________________________________________

I am a simple man who enjoys simple things of life. A good coffee and good music, and I am ready to work. If not coding, I am studying or researching better ways to work, I'm cooking, preparing an espresso or spending free time with my wife and daughter. I'm also a problem-solver/fixer type of guy. I love to fix things, repair and help people. It doesn't matter the subject, I'm always ready to give a hand.

I started in the tech world at the age of 8, with an Intel 80386, coding in Microsoft's BASIC. My first job was at the age of 14, working as a Computer Technician. After that, I worked in a lot of other companies, learning lots of different skills and doing things like Network, Linux and Windows Server administration, Web development (front and back-end), e-learning and multimedia development, Web project management.

For almost six years I worked at an advertisement agency. In the beginning, I was the IT guy, but in less than one year I moved to Web Development department.
Having the opportunity to work with big brands, such as Kraft Foods, Volvo Motors, HSBC Bank, Boticário Group, and many others, I learned many different disciplines and skills. I created from presentations, Web-based application, e-Learnings, to database-driven apps, content managers systems. When I left this job, I was the Lead Web Developer.

In 2009 I started my own company with another two designers as partners, UNBOX Design Studio. Our main goal was to deliver high quality and user-oriented solutions for design and online learning. For almost 9 years, and thousands of successful projects, I developed my career in many ways. Having your own company changes you, for the better. It changed me from a simple Developer to a professional who understands the client needs and budget, B2B, employee’s needs, human resources, design awareness, project management, entrepreneurship, finances, accounting, business laws, tax laws, etc.

But the time to move on came to me in 2017 and we closed the company. But the learning and will to do new things grows bigger.

Currently, I work as a freelance front-end developer and Education Tech Consultant in the corporate education sector.
