I've been creating web and learning content for almost 18 years now. I worked on many projects over these years along big companies like Kraft Foods Brasil, Electrolux Sweden, Volvo Motors, HSBC Bank, Furukawa Electric, GP Strategies, Metlife Brasil, O Boticário and many others.

As a tech enthusiast and an eager learner, I'm always looking for new tools and ways to improve mine and team's quality of life. If I need to learn something new, no problem, just give some time and I will do my best.
