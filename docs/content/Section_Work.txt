I've been creating web and learning content for almost 17 years now. I worked on many projects over these years along big companies like Kraft Foods Brasil, Electrolux Sweden, Volvo Motors, HSBC Bank, Furukawa Electric,  GP Strategies, Metlife Brasil, O Botic√°rio and many others.

In this page, you can find a small selection* of projects that I worked on as a Developer, Team Lead or Project Manager.

* Unfortunately, some of the projects are copyrighted or covered by a non-disclosure agreement and cannot be made available.
