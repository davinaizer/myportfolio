- FOLKS LMS
FOLKS LMS is a Learning Management System based on the open-source LMS project Moodle.  This project was built during my time at my former company, UNBOX. It was designed to be a cost-effective solution in a very competing market. To achieve that, we focused on reducing infrastructure costs.

For the interface side, we created a template-based approach using Bootstrap. The templates were created by the design/UX team, and I was responsible for implementing using Bootstrap, JS, and SASS.

As for the infrastructure, I was responsible for building a web server using AWS EC2 and Ubuntu Server. There were some production-ready instances on AWS Marketplace, but they tend to cost a lot in the long-term. To reduce costs, we choose the free-tier (t2.micro) instance from AWS and would scale the instance according to inbound traffic.

The server was setup using Linux Ubuntu, Apache, MySQL and PHP (LAMP) and a lot of others tailor-made configurations to boost performance, security, and flexibility.

- My Portfolio
It was built from scratch (no boilerplates, for the purpose of learning) using Webpack 4, BabelJS, ReactJS,  SASS, and Bootstrap. I will update with new features and content in the near future, so feel free to stop by again.

- UNBOX Framework AS3
When Flash and ActionScript was the king of multimedia and RIA (Rich Internet Application), this was the main project at UNBOX, the heart of the development team. It was designed to improve in many ways how we made online learning. Before the framework, a 60-minute long course took almost 3 to 4 months to be complete, including all development stages: briefing, planning, content capturing, instructional design, scripting, UI/UX design, front-end development, sequencing, navigation and LMS/SCORM server communication. After the framework was implemented, we decreased the time spent to have a finished product in 3 to 4 weeks. From a technical and financial point of view, it was a great achievement.

The framework was built using Actionscript 3, OOP (object-oriented programming), design patterns/best practices and MVCS architecture (Model-View -Controller-Service).

Later, this framework was ported to HAXE (ported by Tiago Ling) and to JS (by me).

Just to list some available features:
 - Navigation and Sequencing configuration in XML;
 - Page and content animation in XML (XML translation to GSAP animations)
 - Content creation, positioning, and styling using XML. This is particularly relevant because we are talking about Flash/AS, which had very limited HTML and CSS support;
 - Content search engine;
 - Page bookmark;
 - A library of lessons, components, mini-games, assessment system, etc.
 - Many routines were automated using JSFL: image optimization, text extraction (from Flash files to XML), stylesheet creation (based on Flash template files created by the design team), app scaffolding (file generation based on XML configuration file). This was done much before task runners like GULP or GRUNT become famous.

In the latest version of the framework, we even used SASS to create a theming system like Bootstrap and improve the customization.  At that time, these things were amazing in the Flash/Actionscript world.

- UNBOX Framework JS
In 2014 the AS3 version of the framework was fully redesigned in HTML and JS using BackboneJS and Babel. Due to the nature of JS and HTML, the project had a simpler architecture compared to the original made in AS3.

- Electrolux - HR course
One of the latest projects using the UNBOX JS Framework. Still in progress, but worth mentioning. In this project, I'm working as a Tech Consultant and Front-end developer.

- UNBOX Components
UNBOX Components is a set of UI components and learning activities made in AS3 aimed to help designers built online courses.

- DINÂMICA IMAGEM
o Boticário

Dizer que nossa imagem não é importante para fazer uma boa impressão, é deixar de usar uma ferramenta eficiente que temos ao nosso alcance.
Não é de se espantar que a metodologia de venda das Consultoras O Boticário tenha esse nome tão sugestivo.
Para apoiar o treinamento presencial dos multiplicadores das franquias, a UNBOX desenvolveu um pequeno jogo para ver quem sabia aplicar melhor os passos desse método. Com ajuda de alguns personagem para representar situações típicas das lojas, os participantes do jogo são convidados a escolher qual  a melhor resposta para cada etapa da venda.
Não há perdedores nesse jogo, todos ganham ao relembrar o IMAGEM.
