      "description": "When Flash and ActionScript was the king of multimedia and RIA (Rich Internet Application), this was the main project at UNBOX, the heart of the development team. It was designed to improve in many ways how we made online learning. Before the framework, a 60-minute long course took almost 3 to 4 months to be complete, including all development stages: briefing, planning, content capturing, instructional design, scripting, UI/UX design, front-end development, sequencing, navigation and LMS/SCORM server communication. After the framework was implemented, we decreased the time spent to have a finished product in 3 to 4 weeks. From a technical and financial point of view, it was a great achievement.<br /><br />The framework was built using Actionscript 3, OOP (object-oriented programming), design patterns/best practices and MVCS architecture (Model-View -Controller-Service, based on Robotlegs Framework).<br />Later, this framework was ported to HAXE (ported by Tiago Ling) and to JS (by me).<br />Just to list some available features: - Navigation and Sequencing configuration in XML;- Page and content animation in XML (XML translation to GSAP animations)- Content creation, positioning, and styling using XML. This is particularly relevant because we are talking about Flash/AS, which had very limited HTML and CSS support;- Content search engine;- Page bookmark;- A library of lessons, components, mini-games, assessment system, etc. - Many routines were automated using JSFL: image optimization, text extraction (from Flash files to XML), stylesheet creation (based on Flash template files created by the design team), app scaffolding (file generation based on XML configuration file). This was done much before task runners like GULP or GRUNT become famous.<br />In the latest version of the framework, we even used SASS to create a theming system like Bootstrap and improve the customization.  At that time, these things were amazing in the Flash/Actionscript world.",
